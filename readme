new featueres:

Allows directly embedding Gatekeeper ConstraintTemplates and constraints in an ACM policy.
Gatekeeper constraint audit results are aggregated back to the ACM Hub when the constraint is embedded in the policy.
Setting a policy to “inform” mode will set the Gatekeeper constraint’s “enforcementAction” to “warn”.
Setting a policy to “enforce” mode will set the Gatekeeper constraint’s “enforcementAction” to “deny”.
Search links for the “Related Resources” section of such policies are available 
PolicyGenerator support
